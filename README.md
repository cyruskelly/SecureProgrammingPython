### Dependencies
The chat system makes use of the following Python packages and must be installed beforehand:
- Websockets
- dotenv
- cryptography
- Crypto

The following command can be run to install all the required dependencies 
```
pip install websockets python-dotenv cryptography pycryptodome
```

### Compilation Instructions
The server.py must be compiled first before the client as the client will look to connect to a server right away. Compiling and running the client before the server will produce errors and the process will exit. 

 - Open two Terminals


  In one terminal compile and run server.py using
```
  "python server.py"
```

 In another terminal compile and run client.py using
 ```
  "python client.py"
```
